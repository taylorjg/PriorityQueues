I am currently taking Cousera's
[Principles of Reactive Programming](https://class.coursera.org/reactive-002) course. The assignment for week 1 involved writing ScalaCheck property tests for a priority queue. The interface for the priority queue was taken from the following paper by Brodal & Okasaki:

* [Optimal Purely Functional Priority Queues](http://www.brics.dk/RS/96/37/BRICS-RS-96-37.pdf)

As an exercise, I ported my property tests to QuickCkeck and then implemented the priority queue in Haskell based on the ML code in the paper.
